## Content

This repository contains the OUDS Core Flutter library that provides Orange components for its unified design system.

You can find the [detailed technical documentation online](https://flutter.unified-design-system.orange.com/), as well as the [whole design system](https://unified-design-system.orange.com/).

## OUDS

OUDS stands for *Orange Unified Design System*.

This is a new design system, again, but _unified_, aiming to merge all requirements of Orange brands and affiliates to provide a unique design system, consistent across all platforms and for all countries, companies, users, and apps. Guidelines for TV, Flutter, Android, iOS, and web environments will be integrated into a "cohesive" approach, and any Orange-related software, including brand apps like *Parnasse* and *Sosh*, *Orange Innovation Cup* apps, and apps for Orange countries and affiliates will utilize this project in the future.

The project is open source, and topics such as accessibility and ecodesign will also be addressed.

It is intended to replace internal frameworks and the previous [ODS](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ods-flutter) in the near future.

## Tokens version

- **Version**: 1.2.0.

## Other OUDS Libraries

- **ouds_theme_contract**: Contains the semantic tokens and component tokens.
- **ouds_theme_orange**: Contains the theme for the Orange brand.

## Build

### Generate l10n files

**Development process**

* Developers modify `ouds_flutter_en.arb` (and/or other language files).
* To have the translations in the app launched locally, run `flutter gen-l10n` in the `ouds_core/lib` directory.
    * This will regenerate:
        * `ouds_flutter_localizations.dart`
        * `ouds_flutter_localizations_en.dart`
        * other language files.
* These files **must not be** committed and pushed.

**Release the library**

* Pre-step: run `flutter gen-l10n` before creating and publishing the package to generate `ouds_flutter_localizations*.dart`.

## How install

### Pubspec.yaml

## How to use

### Localization

To set up localization for the `ouds_core` library, you need to set the `OudsLocalizations.delegate` in the `localizationsDelegates` properties of the `MaterialApp`. 

```Dart
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Title',
      theme: OrangeTheme().themeData,
      darkTheme: OrangeTheme().darkThemeData,
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      home: const HomePage(title: 'title'),
      builder: (context, child) {
        return OudsTheme(
          themeContract: OrangeTheme(),
          themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
          onColoredSurface: false,
          child: child ?? Container(),
        );
      },
    );
```
