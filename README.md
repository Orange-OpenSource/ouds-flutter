## Content

This repository contains the OUDS Flutter library that provides Orange components for its unified design system, but also a demo application showcasing these different components.

You can find the [detailed technical documentation online](https://flutter.unified-design-system.orange.com/), and also the [whole design system](https://unified-design-system.orange.com/).

## OUDS

OUDS means *Orange Unified Design System*.

This is a new design system, again, but _unified_, trying to merge all requirements of Orange brands and affiliates so as to provide a unique design system, unified across all platforms and for all countries, companies, users and apps.
Guidelines for TV, Flutter, Android, iOS and web environments will be merged in a "cohesive" approach, and any Orange-related softwares including brand apps like *Parnasse* and *Sosh*, *Orange Innovation Cup* apps and Orange countries and affiliates app will use this project in the future.

The project is open source and topics like accessibility and ecodesign should be also managed.

It should replace internal frameworks and also [ODS](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/ods-flutter) in the near future.

## Documentation

Documentation for OUDS Android is available at [flutter.unified-design-system.orange.com](https://android.unified-design-system.orange.com/)
